2	28	Ronaldo double seals Juventus comeback win	Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice as Serie A leaders Juventus came from behind to beat struggling Empoli and maintain their unbeaten start to the season.\r\n\r\nEmpoli, who have not won since the opening day, went ahead when Francesco Caputo fired home from 16 yards.\r\n\r\nJuve had a penalty when Ismael Bennacer shoved over Juve captain Paulo Dybala, with Ronaldo converting.\r\n\r\nThe £99m summer signing then scored a sensational 25-yard effort into the top corner to win the game.\r\n\r\nEmpoli - last season's Serie B champions - played well, but Juve's quality and grit showed as they pulled off a third comeback win of the Serie A season.\r\n\r\nThey are now seven points clear at the top after nine wins and one draw in 10 games, although most other teams still have to play their league games this weekend.\r\n\r\nJuventus have been champions for the past seven years - now, with 28 points from 10 games, this their joint best start to a Serie A season, along with 2012-13.\r\n\r\nRonaldo has now scored seven goals in 12 games for the club, including four in his last three Serie A matches.	2018-10-28 00:00:00	1
4	27	Sri Lanka v England: Joe Denly eyes place in Test side after T20	Joe Denly hopes to put himself in contention for a place in the England Test side after starring in the Twenty20 victory over Sri Lanka.\r\n\r\nDenly, playing his first international in eight years, took four wickets with his leg-breaks and made 20 with the bat as England won by 30 runs.\r\n\r\n"There are a couple of warm-up games, so hopefully I can perform there to put my name in the hat," said the Kent man.\r\n\r\nThe first match in the three-Test series begins on 6 November.\r\nThe 32-year-old not only gives England an option at the top of the order after the retirement of Alastair Cook, but his bowling could prove useful in a series where spin is expected to play a big part.\r\n\r\n"I think being able to bowl will help my case," said Denly, who played nine one-day internationals and five T20s for England in his previous spell as an international cricketer between 2009 and 2010.\r\n\r\nHe told BBC Sport: "To get an opportunity to play for England before that Test series can only give me confidence.\r\n\r\n"It gives me a bit of an idea to what it means to represent England again. I can't wait to get going with the red-ball stuff."\r\n\r\nIn his time away from the England side, Denly has featured in a number of global T20 leagues, playing for teams from Australia, Pakistan and Bangladesh.\r\n\r\nWhen he first played for England, it was mainly as a batsman, but in Colombo he batted at number seven, then opened the bowling with his leg-breaks.\r\n\r\nHe took two wickets in his first two overs, then two in the final over of the match to end with 4-19, the best return by an England bowler in T20 internationals.\r\n\r\n"I land my leg-spinner pretty well," he said. "Being mainly a batsman I have a good sense of what the batter will try to do.\r\n\r\n"It's been a while since I've been in England colours but I'm delighted to be back and contributing.\r\n\r\n"There were a few nerves there, but it was more excitement. I've been really looking forward to it."\r\n\r\nEngland's success in the one-off T20 follows a 3-1 series win in the one-day series.\r\n\r\nThe first of their two warm-up games before the Tests begins on Tuesday.	2018-10-28 00:00:00	3
5	27	England v South Africa	England forward Courtney Lawes is a doubt for the autumn international with South Africa on 3 November because of a recurring back problem.\r\n\r\nThe 29-year-old Northampton Saints player suffered a back spasm on 6 October after sleeping in a hotel bed that was ill-suited to his 6'7" frame.\r\n\r\nHe has left the training camp in the Algarve for specialist UK treatment.\r\n\r\nEngland are already without the injured Chris Robshaw, Joe Launchbury and Billy and Mako Vunipola.\r\n\r\nLawes first experienced back problems on the day of Northampton's defeat by Leicester, and was forced to withdraw during the warm-up to the game.\r\n\r\nEngland forwards coach Steve Borthwick said: "He is expected to return to Portugal early next week. He has taken part in modified training this week."\r\n\r\nThe South Africa match begins a month of Saturday internationals at Twickenham for England, with other matches against New Zealand, Japan and Australia.	2018-10-28 00:00:00	4
6	27	Champion Federer to face Copil in Basel final	Defending champion Roger Federer reached his 14th Swiss Indoors final in Basel with a commanding 6-1 6-4 victory over Russian Daniil Medvedev.\r\n\r\nThe 37-year-old world number three, an eight-time champion here, survived a late break to win in 64 minutes.\r\n\r\nIn Sunday's final he will play world number 93 Marius Copil of Romania, who beat second seed Alexander Zverev of Germany 6-3 6-7 (6-8) 6-4.\r\n\r\nIn Vienna, Kevin Anderson will play Kei Nishikori in the Erste Bank Open final.\r\n\r\nLocal hero Federer, who first reached the Basel final in 2000 and took the title for the first time in 2006, has won three tournaments this year, including the Australian Open that marked his 20th Grand Slam singles title.\r\n\r\nIt was his second win of the year against 20-year-old Medvedev, ranked 20th in the world.\r\n\r\nVictory in the final would put Federer on 99 career titles.\r\n\r\nRomanian 28-year-old Copil served 26 aces in his victory over world number five Zverev as he reached the second ATP final of his career.\r\n\r\nIn Austria, fifth seed Nishikori beat Mikhail Kukushkin of Kazakhstan 6-4 6-3, while South African world number eight Anderson saw off Spain's Fernando Verdasco 6-3 3-6 6-4.	2018-10-28 00:00:00	5
7	27	WGC-HSBC Champions	Tony Finau takes a three-shot lead into the final day of the WGC-HSBC Champions in Shanghai after Justin Rose faltered towards the end of round three.\r\n\r\nEnglishman Rose had a one-shot advantage after nine holes but dropped three shots on 17 and 18 for a two-under-par 70 to sit three off the lead.\r\n\r\nHe is alongside American duo Patrick Reed and Xander Schauffele on 10 under.\r\n\r\nFinau, who was one of few stars for the United States in the Ryder Cup, ended his two-under round with three birdies.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, Rose, who could move above Americans Brooks Koepka and Dustin Johnson to the top of the world rankings with a win, found the bunker at 17 for a double bogey and the water at 18 for a bogey.\r\n\r\nReigning Race to Dubai champion Tommy Fleetwood is five shots off the lead alongside American Andrew Putnam.\r\n\r\nEnglishman Fleetwood had been one off the lead after birdieing the third, fourth and 10th and dropping a shot on the fifth. But he triple-bogeyed the 14th after finding the water before picking a shot back up on the last.\r\n\r\nNorthern Irishman Rory McIlroy's problems continued with a 75 and the four-time major champion is tied for 60th on eight over, while Koepka is one over and Johnson is four over.\r\n\r\n"I've got a world-class field chasing after me," said Finau, who is searching for his first European Tour win. "This is the position you want to be in and I'll be looking to close out my first tournament in this position, which is exciting for me.\r\n\r\n"I didn't have a lot going my way for the first half of the day and Rosey was making his run.\r\n\r\n"I was just really pleased I was able to finish that way and get some momentum going into tomorrow."	2018-10-28 00:00:00	6
8	27	Drugs cocktail ban for Russian thrower	A Russian hammer thrower has been banned for four years after testing positive for a cocktail of four different drugs, says Associated Press.\r\n\r\nRussia's athletics federation says Tatyana Kachegina's sample contained the anabolic steroids turinabol and stanozolol, as well as meldonium and growth hormone promoter GHRP-2.\r\n\r\nThe federation says bans were also handed to four other Russian athletes.\r\n\r\nThree were for positive doping tests and one for failing to give a sample.\r\n\r\nThe Russian athletics team have been banned from international track competitions since 2015 because of evidence of state-sponsored doping.\r\n\r\nKachegina and the others banned on Thursday are not among the many Russians who have been approved by the IAAF to compete internationally as individuals.	2018-10-28 00:00:00	7
9	27	Reedie rejects Froome case criticism	World Anti-Doping Association president Sir Craig Reedie has rejected criticism of how Chris Froome's asthma drug case was handled and will not resign.\r\n\r\nThe Movement for Credible Cycling said Reedie should quit, calling Froome's case - dropped in July - "devastating" for the sport's credibility.\r\n\r\nIt also questioned Wada's independence, and its approach to Russia's anti-doping body and painkiller tramadol.\r\n\r\nBut Reedie said Wada was "stronger and more effective than it has ever been".\r\n\r\nIn a letter seen by BBC Sport, the 77-year-old Briton said he would see out his second term until the end of 2019, adding: "In everything we do, Wada is keeping the athletes to the fore."\r\n\r\nBritish four-time Tour de France champion Froome was under investigation after more than the allowed level of legal drug salbutamol was found in his urine.\r\n\r\nWada accepted there was no breach and cycling's world governing body, the UCI, dropped on the case on 2 July after nine months.\r\n\r\nThe MPCC - which represents seven of the 18 World Tour teams, 23 professional continental outfits, nine continental teams, six UCI women teams and 264 riders - said that following Froome's case it "laments the way sanctions are not applied equally and procedures are not followed equally, which is devastating for the credibility of the sport".\r\n\r\nReedie replied: "Wada remains convinced that the UCI reached the correct and fair outcome in what was a very complex case."\r\n\r\nHe added that the MPCC had "over-simplified" the case "without having knowledge of the voluminous file of the case and both the scientific and legal challenges it raised".	2018-10-28 00:00:00	8
10	27	Warriors' Cousins ejected - despite being already sidelined	NBA bad boy DeMarcus Cousins was sent off during the Golden State Warriors game on Friday evening - despite already being sidelined by injury.\r\n\r\nCousins, 28, was sat near the bench when he earned a 14th career ejection for arguing with New York Knicks player Enes Kanter and referee Scott Foster.\r\n\r\nFoster said Cousins was "warned" before being "ejected for one technical foul for unsportsmanlike conduct".\r\n\r\nThe incident occurred in the first quarter of the Warriors' 128-100 win.\r\n\r\nCousins, who has yet to play for the Warriors this season because of an Achilles injury, "took exception" to the warning, said Foster.\r\n\r\nBut the four-time All-Star was only issued one technical foul at Madison Square Garden rather than the two normally needed for a sending-off - because of the manner of his response to the official.\r\n\r\n"I did check with Scott," Warriors coach Steve Kerr said after the game.\r\n\r\n"He said [the ejection] was because he had already warned him and then he kept going at Scott, I guess, so I'll talk to him about it."\r\n\r\nCousins, who signed a one-year deal with the Warriors during the off-season, has also earned 119 technical fouls during his career.	2018-10-28 00:00:00	9
1	27	What happened in the Premier League!	Liverpool moved back to the top of the Premier League as they beat Cardiff City 4-1.\r\n\r\nSadio Mane scored twice and Mohamed Salah and substitute Xherdan Shaqiri were also on target for Jurgen Klopp's side, with Callum Paterson scoring for the visitors.\r\n\r\nThe Reds are three points clear of second-placed Manchester City, who can return to the top on goal difference if they win at Tottenham on Monday.\r\n\r\nRoberto Pereyra scored a goal of the season contender for Watford as they beat Huddersfield 3-0, a result which means the Terriers drop to the bottom of the table.\r\n\r\nStarting on the touchline, the Argentine dribbled his way through several defenders for the opening goal, before Gerard Deulofeu scored a sublime second and Isaac Success added a third.\r\n\r\nPremier League reaction\r\nBournemouth maintained their strong start to the season with a 3-0 victory at 10-man Fulham.\r\n\r\nCallum Wilson was on target twice - either side of David Brooks' goal - while the Cottagers had Kevin McDonald sent off for two bookings with just under 20 minutes remaining.\r\n\r\nStriker Glenn Murray, 35, scored his 100th Brighton goal as they beat Wolves 1-0.\r\n\r\nSouthampton and Newcastle ended in a goalless draw.\r\n\r\nLeicester needed a late, deflected strike from Wilfred Ndidi to claim a point against 10-man West Ham, who had led through Fabian Balbuena's goal. Mark Noble was sent off for the Hammers.\r\n\r\nBrighton 1-0 Wolves\r\nFulham 0-3 Bournemouth\r\nLiverpool 4-1 Cardiff\r\nSouthampton 0-0 Newcastle\r\nWatford3-0 Huddersfield\r\nLeicester 1-1 West Ham\r\nIn the Championship, Billy Sharp scored a hat-trick as Sheffield United went top of the table with a 4-2 against Wigan, West Brom missed out on the chance to move into second place with a 1-1 draw against Blackburn, and Norwich continued their climb, sitting third after a 1-0 victory over Brentford.\r\n\r\nLeeds are second after a controversial late goal from Kemar Roofe gave them a 1-1 draw at home with Nottingham Forest.\r\n\r\nIn Saturday's early game, Derby County's Jayden Bogle scored a late own goal to deny the Rams victory at Middlesbrough, who had led in the opening 20 minutes after George Friend bundled into his own net.\r\n\r\nKilmarnock drew 1-1 with Hamilton to move above Celtic and into second in the Scottish Premiership.	2018-10-28 00:00:00	1
11	27	'Have a seizure and get over it!'	A 19-year-old medal winner has revealed how she was told to stop swimming because of her epilepsy.\r\n\r\nImogen Clark, from Morton, Derbyshire, had her first seizure at the bottom of a pool.\r\n\r\nShe was diagnosed aged 14 with photosensitive epilepsy, which even caused her to be resuscitated poolside, and led to doctors and her mother to ask her to stop swimming.\r\n\r\nBut the Loughborough-based swimmer placed second in the 50m breaststroke at the European Championships in 2018 and is now ranked fourth in the world in her category.\r\n\r\nOrganisers of the competition asked press to stop using flash photography when she stepped onto the podium.	2018-10-28 00:00:00	10
15	28	Sri Lanka v England: Jos Buttler likely to replace Jonny Bairstow, says Joe Root	England captain Joe Root says Jos Buttler is likely to keep wicket in the first Test against Sri Lanka next week if Jonny Bairstow is ruled out.\r\n\r\nBairstow is recovering from an ankle injury picked up while playing football, but Root says England have options with Buttler and Ben Foakes.\r\n\r\nThe first of three Tests starts in Galle on Tuesday, 6 November.\r\n\r\n"Although Jonny will be a big loss, we've got great players that can come in and rebalance the team," said Root.\r\n\r\n"It's day-by-day with Jonny at the minute. He's actually made good strides and recovered a little bit quicker than we anticipated, but it's still a long way to go.\r\n\r\n"It's obviously a big three-match series, so we need to weigh all that up and make a decision closer to the first game."\r\n\r\nSurrey wicketkeeper Foakes was called up to England's Test squad as cover for the injured Bairstow.\r\n\r\nBut asked whether Lancashire's Buttler would be the man to start in Galle, Root told BBC Sport: "That will probably be the likely scenario.\r\n\r\n"But the reason we called Ben up is because he's a high-quality keeper and we give ourselves another way of balancing the side out and give ourselves a chance of winning.\r\n\r\n"These are all different options we've given ourselves going into this series and it's a really nice position to be in."\r\n\r\nRoot says warm-up games against a Sri Lanka Cricket Board President's XI will give him a chance to assess the conditions and his team for the first Test.\r\n\r\n"I've got a strong idea of what the core of it looks like, but we have got some great options," he added.\r\n\r\n"We are going to make sure we've got a very balanced side that gives ourselves the best chance of winning in these conditions."	2018-10-29 00:00:00	3
16	28	 Elina Svitolina beats Sloane Stephens for biggest win of career	Elina Svitolina beat Sloane Stephens to claim the biggest title of her career at the WTA Finals in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe first Ukrainian to be crowned champion, Svitolina recovered from a difficult start to win 3-6 6-2 6-2.\r\n\r\nStephens, the 2017 US Open champion, controlled the first set but Svitolina broke three times in the second.\r\n\r\nThe 24-year-old then repeated the feat in the decider to become the first player to go unbeaten at the tournament since Serena Williams in 2013.\r\n\r\n"It is amazing. I am very pleased with my performance this week," said Svitolina, who has won her past nine finals on the WTA Tour and not lost one in the last two seasons.\r\n\r\n"There were nerves early on but I was just trying to fight for every ball and I think that made the difference in the end."\r\n\r\nAmerican Stephens, the world number six, raced into a 3-0 lead in the opening set and the 25-year-old went on to wrap it up in 46 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe trend of this tournament suggested the match would go to three sets, however - 10 matches have gone the distance this week, beating the previous high of six - and it duly did so when Svitolina ran away with the second set.\r\n\r\nAnd the world number seven continued her dominance into the final set, breaking three times once more to secure the title.\r\n\r\n"Sloane played amazing tennis so I really had to play my best tennis to win," Svitolina added.	2018-10-29 00:00:00	5
